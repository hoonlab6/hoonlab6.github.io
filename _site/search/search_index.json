"/docs/software/how-to-install", "text": "how to install softwaredid you know that you are empowered to install your own software if needed let stalk about different ways to go about this building software from source using a package manager using containersbuilding software from sourcemuch software is available as source code and can be configured to target a local directory for installation the process after downloading the source archive and unpacking it into a new subdirectory usually involves some combination of the configure and make commands configure prefix home local make make test make installif you download source code and see that there is a configure or a makefile youcan usually look for a readme or install file to see complete instructions what does the prefix mean the prefix directory is where build products will end up organized in subdirectories e g bin lib and include in the example above newly built software is installed in a hidden subdirectory of your home directory local but you can choose any subdirectory you like for example it could be that your home is filled up and you want to have a base for software in yourscratch mkdir p scratch softwarewhether you use local or your scratch you will want to modify your shell environment so new software can be easily found so let s open up our bashrc and add a few lines to our path export path home local bin path orexport path scratch software bin path while this method works well for simple applications and libraries more complex software may require you to apply patches or build any dependencies that are not already installed luckily there are a number of tools that can automate this process using a package managerpackage managers provide simple single command installation of software from a central repository usually with little or no additional configuration required this is the most convenient method for most users and you ll probably want to fall back on a manual build only when a package is not available in your preferred package manager linuxbrewlinuxbrew is a port of the homebrew package manager for macos installation is simple ruby e curl fssl https raw githubusercontent com linuxbrew install master install by default both linuxbrew itself and all managed software are installed in linuxbrew so you ll want to add this to your path again in your bashrc export path home linuxbrew bin paththe brew command is used to search the repository get information on software and install packages let s look for something fun brew search nyancat brew info nyancat brew install nyancatlet s run it linuxbrew is great because it can also update itself and the list of available packages and upgrade already installed software when new versions become available brew update update linuxbrew brew update nyancat update a packagespackspack is a package manager targeted at scientific computing it has support for fewer packages than linuxbrew and is a bit more difficult to install configure and use but it provides far more extensive control over versions dependencies and build time options when installing software spack also supports installing more than one version of a single package or multiple installations of the same version with different build options and integrates with farmshare s existing module system allowing you to select from among those versions at runtime to install it just clone the spack git repository git clone https github com llnl spack git spackin this example spack and managed software is installed in spack but you can choose another directory if you like you should probably add home spack bin to your path but unlike linuxbrew installed software is not linked in spack bin instead spack automatically creates modules that manage the environment for each package you ll need to enable shell integration by running source home spack share spack setup env sh sh or bash source home spack share spack setup env csh cshso that you can load the modules the spack command can be used to search the software repository and get information on packages spack list python spack info pythonwhen building a package you can control a number of options including the specific version to install using what variant to build and the exact versions of any dependencies that will be installed and even which compiler to use the list of options provided is called a spec you can list installed packages and load a particular version according to its spec spack install python 3 5 2 spack load python 3 5 2spack can t update itself but because it is a git repository you can check out releases as they are tagged or use git pull to stay in sync with the latest changes it also won t upgrade installed packages automatically but you can use spack install to build a new version whenever one becomes available and choose which version to load by spec run spack help for details on syntax and usage and read the excellent spack manual for more information using containersanother option for running software with special requirements or missing dependencies is containerization you can pull a container of interest using singularity for example here again is nyancat singularity pull docker supertest2014 nyanand then execute commands to the container run it like a binary or shell inside singularity exec nyan latest sif which nyancat singularity run nyan latest sif singularity shell nyan latest sifyou get the same result see the singularity user guidefor more examples and getting started important it is essential that you pull containers first and
